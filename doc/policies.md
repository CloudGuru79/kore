# Policy Controls

## Pod-Security Policies

Examples of how these are used are in the examples directory. Managed pod policy provides a generic means to manage the pod security policies across the estate. The policies can be enforced across all clusters in the teams, filter by teams or target specific clusters. In the future we might simplify the process by the use of tags and labels. Thus rather than selecting apply to cluster x, y and z, admin can apply policy to dev, prod, ci.
