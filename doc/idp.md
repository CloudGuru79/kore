# Kore IDP Support

Kore can be configured to use external identities through an Identity Provider (IDP).

The IDP in use can be either:
- Configured using a broker that supports many social and enterprise identity providers that can be configured using the Kore Web UI ([DEX](./dex.md))
- Configured directly using an Open ID Connect Provider ([OIDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect)).
