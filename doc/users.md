# Make IT Simple for Everyone

## The Developer

+ Self serve Kubernetes clusters with best practice
+ On board and off board your teammates
+ Manage your Role Based Access Controls

You know how to work with containers or you’re starting that journey, but learning Kubernetes and Cloud is complicated and not necessarily a good use of your time. You just want to start deploying applications and using in-cluster or cloud services to start showing off your great work!

With Kore an administrator can configure a set of default known cluster best practices so you and your teammates can provision clusters safely and securely. You can on-board and off-board your own users, with them automatically getting access so you can iterate and deploy applications easily.

You can see what versions are deployed where, generate robot tokens for your Continuous Integration system and start iterating quickly and securely! With out-of-the-box developer roles and policies, you know that your applications are meeting the security requirements they need to!

## The DevOps

+ Define best practice clusters as plans for developer teams to self-serve
+ Push user and application policies to clusters to enforce organisation wide controls
+ Iterate cluster validation as Code in your CI pipelines
+ Improve Kubernetes cluster security with security policies

You know what your developers need, they are also not shy of telling you! But you want to make sure that they get reliable, scalable and secure services before they consume them. Configuring all of this takes time and some of the components can be very complicated and time consuming to do correctly.

Not only that, but there is the cloud provisioning and architecture, that adds another hurdle to get over before teams can even consume Kubernetes and other cloud services! With Kore, we decided to enable cloud setup, as cloud accounts or projects are free, you can isolate teams to accounts, making cloud cost management, security and access controls simpler!

You can also setup default Kubernetes cluster plans that developer teams can consume without you needing to run CI, code or scripts. You can validate the plans work as they should once and then make them available. This might be anything from a Developer plan that is a single availability zone with cheap instance types, through to production plans with enhanced security settings across multiple availability zones for resilience and on-demand instances.

You can also define sensible policies globally, enhancing the security footprint once across all of your teams, so you know that everyone is working consistently and safely!

## The SecOps (Security Operations)

+ Work with DevOps teams to define security controls for teams centrally
+ Enable auditability on teams and Kubernetes cluster builds

Technology is moving quickly, but security needs to stay paramount! You don’t want to slow Developers or DevOps teams down, but you want assurances that applications and cloud services are all configured securely. You know that there are products that pertain to doing security, but getting a good oversight on the risks across the platforms, tools and applications is difficult, even with these products.

Kore can provide easy to understand security policies that can enforce security best practices into all teams Kubernetes clusters.
