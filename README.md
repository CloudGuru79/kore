## Getting Started

### Administrator Setup

*Note* This is just to get up and running locally, not suitable to run as production like this!

First checkout the repository:

`git checkout git@github.com/appvia/kore`

And run make demo

```
cd kore
make demo
```

*Note*: You will not be able to login to the clusters, as it will require an external IDP, (for that you will need to host kore with a consumable endpoint for authentication)/


Steps:
1. Setup cloud
2. Setup SSO
3. Setup plans

Once complete developer teams can login and create teams and clusters in your cloud provider.


There are two ways to setup Kore:

1. [With the CLI]()
2. [Using the web frontend]()


#### With the CLI


`git checkout git@github.com/appvia/kore` 

#### Using the web frontend
