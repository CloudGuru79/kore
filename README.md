## Overview
Kubernetes is an amazing open source project that really helps businesses with container management and scheduling. As it is fast becoming more of a commodity, especially with cloud offerings such as GKE, EKS and AKS, there is still a lot of configuration that could lead to unnecessary cloud costs, security risks, bad practice and poor visibility across multiple teams in your organisation.

Kore is there to bring the sensible and secure to hand-cranked and commoditised Kubernetes!
